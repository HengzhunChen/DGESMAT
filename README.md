DGESMAT
==============

To use this code, cd into the dgesmat directory and type `DGESMAT_startup`
in command line or run DGESMAT_startup.m to set up all paths.

You can then cd into the example directory, and run the corresponding 
example for some simple models.

At this point (August, 2022), DGESMAT appears to need to MATLAB version 
R2021b or higher. Some earlier versions may not work.
